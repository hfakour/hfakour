# Hassan Fakour

Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub.

Iâ€™m someone who loves exploring technology and learning new skills by building real things. Whether itâ€™s data science, web, mobile, or AI, I enjoy getting my hands dirty and figuring things out as I go.

## About Me
- Iâ€™m currently a Masterâ€™s student at Shahid Beheshti University.
- Iâ€™m always looking for projects and opportunities to work alongside professional developers, so I can pick up tips, tricks, and industry best practices.
- My main background is in **Python** and data science, but Iâ€™m curious about all kinds of tech: web development, mobile apps, and AI.
- I believe the best way to learn is by doing and collaborating on real projects.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

I am actively developing teaching materials and hands-on tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks.  
- Recently, I completed a comprehensive **Matplotlib** tutorial, and my **NumPy** guide is almost ready (just needs some final polish).
- Iâ€™m currently building new resources on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and planning to cover **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in the near future.
- Next up: finishing full tutorials on **Pandas** and **Python basics**.

If youâ€™re interested in practical, example-driven Jupyter notebooks for data science and AI, stay tunedâ€”or reach out to collaborate!
